## Async/Await in Python: When Should You Use It, and When Not?

### TL,DR

- **When should you use async/await?** I/O-bound operations with concurrency potential
- **When should you NOT use async/await?** CPU-bound operations and simple sequential tasks
- **How does async/await improve performance?** By allowing concurrent I/O operations
- **What are common pitfalls?** Forgetting to await, using blocking operations, poor error handling

### When to Use Async/Await

Think of async/await as a way to manage a single chef in a very busy kitchen. The chef can start cooking one dish (an I/O task), and while waiting for it to simmer or bake, they can start preparing another dish instead of just standing around. This is called **cooperative multitasking**.

Use async/await for tasks that spend most of their time waiting for external resources. This is ideal for:

- **Network Operations**: Building web servers, API clients, or web scrapers. The program spends most of its time waiting for responses from a network.

    - Example: A web server handling thousands of simultaneous connections. While one connection is waiting for a database query to finish, the server can handle requests from other connections.

- **Database Interactions**: Running multiple database queries concurrently. The program can send off several queries and process the results as they arrive, rather than one by one.

- **File System Operations**: Reading or writing multiple files at once, especially over a network. The program waits for the slow disk or network I/O to complete.

- **Real-time Applications**: Developing applications like chat servers or streaming services where the program must remain responsive to many clients simultaneously.

### When Not to Use Async/Await
Async/await is the wrong tool for tasks that require significant processing power from the CPU. Sticking with our chef analogy, if a task involves chopping a huge pile of vegetables (a CPU-bound task), the chef is fully occupied. They can't switch to another task until the chopping is done. Asyncio provides no benefit here because there is no "waiting" time to utilize.

Do not use async/await for:

- **Heavy Computations**: Complex mathematical calculations, scientific simulations, or heavy data analysis. These tasks keep the CPU 100% busy.

- **Data Processing**: Tasks like video encoding, image manipulation, or large-scale data transformation.

- **Blocking Synchronous Code**: If your code relies on a library that is not async-compatible and performs long-running, blocking operations, asyncio will be stuck waiting for it, freezing the entire event loop.
