# Compare Flask vs FastAPI vs Django REST Framework â€” pros/cons for building large APIs.

## TL,DR
Django is the "batteries-included" monolith, FastAPI is the high-performance API specialist, and Flask is the minimalist's toolkit.

- Choose Django if: You are building a large, content-heavy web application with features like user accounts, an admin panel, and complex database interactions. Speed of initial development and a robust, secure foundation are priorities.

- Choose FastAPI if: Your primary goal is to build a high-performance, scalable API. You value modern Python features, automatic data validation, and interactive documentation.

- Choose Flask if: You are working on a smaller application, a microservice, or a prototype. You prefer a minimalist approach and want the flexibility to choose your own components. A gentle learning curve is also a consideration.

## Python Web Frameworks: A Tale of Three Philosophies

| Feature | Django | FastAPI | Flask |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Philosophy** | Batteries-included, "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) | Performance, speed, and modern Python features | Micro-framework, simplicity, and flexibility |
| **Primary Use Case** | Complex, data-driven web applications | High-performance APIs and microservices | Small to medium-sized applications, prototypes |
| **Performance** | Good, but can be slower due to its size | Excellent, built for speed with asynchronous support | Good, but synchronous by default |
| **Built-in Features** | ORM, admin panel, authentication, templating engine | Data validation, automatic API documentation | Routing, request handling, and templating basics |
| **Learning Curve** | Steeper due to its comprehensive nature | Moderate, especially if new to async programming | Gentle, easy for beginners to pick up |
