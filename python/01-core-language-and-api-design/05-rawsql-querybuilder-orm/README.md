# Difference between ORM, query builder, and raw SQL ‚Äî when do you use raw SQL?

| Feature                      | Raw SQL üó£Ô∏è                                                                          | Query Builder üß±                                                                   | ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) ü§ñ                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Level of Abstraction**     | None. You write the exact query.                                                    | Low. A programmatic interface to build SQL queries.                                | High. Maps database tables directly to application objects.                |
| **Control & Flexibility**    | **Maximum.** Full access to all database features.                                  | High. Can construct most queries, but may limit access to obscure features.        | Medium. Optimized for common operations; complex queries can be difficult. |
| **Ease of Use & Dev Speed**  | Low. Verbose and requires deep SQL knowledge.                                       | Medium. Faster and less error-prone than raw SQL.                                  | **Highest.** Significantly reduces boilerplate for CRUD operations.        |
| **Security (SQL Injection)** | **Manual.** You are fully responsible for sanitizing all inputs.                    | **High.** Automatically handles parameterization, preventing most attacks.         | **Highest.** Manages all queries, providing excellent built-in protection. |
| **Performance**              | **Highest.** No overhead or translation layer.                                      | High. Minimal overhead from building the query string.                             | Medium. The abstraction layer can sometimes generate inefficient queries.  |
| **Database Portability**     | Low. Queries are often tied to a specific SQL dialect (e.g., PostgreSQL vs. MySQL). | Medium. Can translate many common queries, but complex ones may need rewriting.    | **High.** Excellent portability, as the ORM handles dialect differences.   |
| **Primary Use Case**         | Performance-critical tasks and highly complex, database-specific queries.           | Building dynamic queries where full control is needed without writing raw strings. | Rapid application development, especially for standard CRUD functionality. |
