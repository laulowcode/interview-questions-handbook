# Rate limiting: how do you protect APIs from abuse (small DDoS, spam) using rate limiting? -

## 1. The Core Concept: What is Rate Limiting?

**Rate limiting is the practice of controlling the number of requests a user or client can make to an API within a specific time window.** **If the client exceeds this limit, subsequent requests are temporarily blocked.**

The primary goals are:

* **Prevent Abuse:** Stop bad actors from overwhelming your service with requests (spam, credential stuffing, denial-of-service attacks).
* **Ensure Fair Usage:** Prevent a single high-volume user from degrading the service quality for all other users.
* **Maintain Stability:** Protect your backend resources (servers, databases) from being overloaded, thus preventing crashes and ensuring high availability.
* **Manage Costs:** In a cloud environment, excessive traffic can directly translate to higher costs. **Rate limiting helps control this.**

When a client is rate-limited, the API should respond with an HTTP status code ** **`<span class="citation-34">429 Too Many Requests</span>`** **. ** It's also best practice to include headers that inform the client about their status:

* `<span class="citation-33">X-RateLimit-Limit</span>`: The total number of requests allowed in the current window.
* `<span class="citation-32">X-RateLimit-Remaining</span>`: The number of requests remaining in the current window.
* `<span class="citation-31">X-RateLimit-Reset</span>`: The timestamp (in UTC epoch seconds) when the limit will reset.

**HTTP**

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
Retry-After: 60
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1727858500

{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
}
```

## 2. Identifying the "Client"

To enforce a limit, you first need to identify who is making the request. There are several common methods, often used in combination:

* **By IP Address:** The simplest method. **You track the number of requests coming from a single IP.**
  * **Pros:** Easy to implement, doesn't require authentication.
  * **Cons:** Unreliable. **Multiple users can share a single public IP (e.g., in an office or behind a NAT).** **A malicious actor can easily switch IPs using proxies or a botnet.**
* **By API Key:** For authenticated clients. Each developer or application is issued a unique key.
  * **Pros:** Much more reliable for tracking application-level usage. Allows you to create different tiers (e.g., Free vs. Paid).
  * **Cons:** Requires users to be authenticated.
* **By User ID / Session Token:** For user-facing applications (e.g., a mobile app). You limit based on the logged-in user.
  * **Pros:** The most accurate way to enforce per-user limits.
  * **Cons:** Only works for authenticated traffic.

## 3. Common Rate Limiting Algorithms

**Several algorithms can be used to track and enforce limits.** The choice depends on your specific needs for accuracy, performance, and complexity.

| Algorithm                        | How it Works                                                                                                                       | Pros                                                              | Cons                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Token Bucket**           | A bucket is filled with "tokens" at a steady rate. Each request consumes one token. If the bucket is empty, the request is denied. | Handles bursts of traffic well (as long as tokens are available). | Can be slightly more complex to implement.                                           |
| **Leaky Bucket**           | Requests are added to a queue (the bucket). The queue is processed at a fixed rate, like water leaking from a hole.                | Smooths out requests into a steady stream. Predictable outflow.   | Does not handle bursts well; a burst of requests will fill the queue and be dropped. |
| **Sliding Window Log**     | Stores a timestamp for every request in memory (e.g., in a Redis sorted set). Counts how many timestamps fall within the window.   | Very accurate.                                                    | Can be memory-intensive, especially for high-traffic APIs with long time windows.    |
| **Sliding Window Counter** | A hybrid approach. It keeps a counter for the current and previous time window, providing a rolling average.                       | Good balance of performance and accuracy. Low memory footprint.   | Can be slightly less accurate than the Sliding Window Log in certain edge cases.     |

For most use cases, **Token Bucket** and **Sliding Window Counter** are excellent choices.

## 4. Where to Implement Rate Limiting

1. **At the API Gateway (Recommended):**
   * **How:** Modern API gateways (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Kong, Apigee, NGINX Plus) have built-in, highly-performant rate-limiting capabilities.
   * **Why:** This is often the best place. **It protects your entire backend infrastructure by stopping abusive traffic at the edge, before it consumes any of your application server resources.** It also separates security concerns from your business logic.
2. **In Middleware (In your Application Code):**
   * **How:** You can add middleware to your web framework (e.g., for Express.js, Django, ASP.NET Core) that intercepts every request and checks it against a counter, often stored in a centralized cache like Redis.
   * **Why:** This gives you more flexibility and control. You can implement complex, application-specific logic, such as applying different limits based on the user's subscription tier, which might be hard to configure in a generic API gateway.
3. **At the Load Balancer / Reverse Proxy:**
   * **How:** Some advanced load balancers and reverse proxies (like NGINX or HAProxy) can be configured to perform rate limiting.
   * **Why:** This is also a good option for stopping traffic at the edge. It's more efficient than application-level middleware but might be less flexible than a full API gateway.

## 5. A Practical, Layered Strategy for Protection

Don't rely on a single rule. **A robust strategy involves multiple layers of protection.**

* **Layer 1: IP-based Limiting (The Blunt Instrument):**
  * **Purpose:** Catch unsophisticated bots, scrapers, and network-level attacks.
  * **Example Rule:** Allow a maximum of  **500 requests per IP per minute** . This is a general safety net.
* **Layer 2: API Key / User-based Limiting (The Business Rule):**
  * **Purpose:** Enforce fair usage and define different product tiers.
  * **Example Rules:**
    * **Free Tier Key:** 100 requests per hour.
    * **Pro Tier Key:** 5,000 requests per hour.
    * **Logged-in User:** 200 requests per minute.
* **Layer 3: Endpoint-Specific Limiting (The Surgical Tool):**
  * **Purpose:** Protect sensitive or computationally expensive endpoints.
  * **Example Rules:**
    * `POST /login`: **5 attempts per IP per minute** to protect against credential stuffing.
    * `POST /register`: **3 attempts per IP per hour** to prevent spam account creation.
    * `GET /search`: **60 requests per user per minute** as it can be database-intensive.
