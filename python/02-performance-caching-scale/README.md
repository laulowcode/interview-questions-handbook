## ðŸš€ Group B: Performance, Caching & Scale

- [ ] Redis caching: API result caching, DB query caching, cache invalidation â€” common patterns
- [ ] Rate limiting: how do you protect APIs from abuse (small DDoS, spam) using rate limiting?
- [ ] Background jobs/task queues: Celery vs Dramatiq vs RQ â€” which do you choose and why?
- [ ] Streaming/chunked responses: when does backend need to stream data? How to implement?
- [ ] Authentication/authorization: JWT vs sessions vs OAuth2 â€” which fits when?
- [ ] API security: CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection â€” how to prevent SQL Injection in Python?
- [ ] Logging & structured logging: how do you implement logging to support debugging & production?
- [ ] Monitoring & observability: metrics (Prometheus), tracing (OpenTelemetry), health checks â€” how to set up?
- [ ] Performance optimization: profiling (cProfile, pyinstrument, yappi), finding bottlenecks â€” your approach?
- [ ] Memory leaks in Python â€” common causes (circular refs not GC'd, holding references, oversized cache) and detection methods
