## ⚡ Group C: Concurrency, Async, IO & Data

- [ ] Concurrency vs parallelism in Python: threading vs multiprocessing vs async — when to use each?
- [ ] Optimizing I/O bound vs CPU bound — example: endpoint processing images or large JSON, how do you handle it?
- [ ] Streaming upload/download of large files: chunked upload, chunked download, buffer size — temp files, security
- [ ] Rate of failures & retry logic: Circuit Breaker, Exponential Backoff, Retry Policy — deployment strategies
- [ ] Transactional email/notifications: how to queue + retry when email sending fails
- [ ] Data validation/serialization: Pydantic vs Marshmallow vs Django Validators — your experience
- [ ] Handling schema changes: you have old data, new version, backward compatibility — what's your strategy?
- [ ] API documentation: OpenAPI/Swagger/Redoc — how do you automate this?
- [ ] API contracts: client-server contracts, versioning, using contract testing
- [ ] Asynchronous messaging (message brokers) like RabbitMQ/Kafka/Redis PubSub — when to use; example patterns
