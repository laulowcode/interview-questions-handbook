## 🏗️ Group D: Deployment, Architecture, Reliability

- [ ] Rate/quota per user/per API key: designing systems for fair resource sharing
- [ ] Implementing CI/CD: test, build, deploy — your ideal vs reality workflow
- [ ] Containerization & Docker: best practices for Python backend (layer caching, Alpine vs Debian, image size...)
- [ ] Deployment on Kubernetes: pods, replica sets, health checks, readiness, liveness probes
- [ ] Zero downtime deployment: blue-green, canary, rolling updates — how to implement for Python backend?
- [ ] Logging and debugging in production: log levels, log rotation, log aggregation
- [ ] Complex data migrations: schema + data changes (e.g., split tables, merge tables, change types) — how to avoid downtime or data loss
- [ ] Database backup & restore: strategy, frequency, testing restores
- [ ] Handling secrets/configuration: managing secrets, not committing to repo, using vault/AWS Parameter Store/Kubernetes secrets
- [ ] Environment separation: dev/staging/prod — how to configure and deploy differently without mistakes?
