## üåê Group E: Scalability, Resilience & Advanced Topics

- [ ] API rate & throughput scaling: when traffic doubles/increases 10x, what do you do to make backend handle it?
- [ ] Load balancing: how to distribute traffic, sticky sessions, stateless services
- [ ] HTTP-level caching: CDN, reverse proxy (nginx), cache headers, expiration, ETag
- [ ] Handling failures: circuit breaker, fallback, timeouts ‚Äî when downstream endpoints are slow or dead, how do you handle it?
- [ ] Data consistency between services/microservices: eventual consistency vs strong consistency ‚Äî trade-offs?
- [ ] Observability with microservices: cross-service tracing, distributed context, correlation IDs
- [ ] Operational costs: compute cost, database cost, cache cost ‚Äî how do you monitor & optimize?
- [ ] Security audits & pentesting: list steps you'd take to audit API/backend for vulnerabilities/security issues
- [ ] When to use GraphQL instead of REST vs gRPC vs HTTP/2 ‚Äî comparisons
- [ ] Feature flags & A/B testing: how to integrate into backend; rolling out new features without affecting existing users
